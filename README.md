# Bait

The following simple projects have been used as bait.

## Mossbunker

An IMDB watch list app in which you can mark movies as seen and which movies you want to watch later. The app uses the [IMDB open api](http://www.omdbapi.com/).
Use whatever technology you like. The focus of the assessment is on the chosen methodology and clear design and not the amount of functionality.

## Nightcrawler

An API with OpenAPI3 documented endpoints that can convert Excel docs to JSON.
Use a technology of your choice from the [top 20 of TIOBE](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).
